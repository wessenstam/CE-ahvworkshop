Environmental overview
+++++++++++++++++++

Th CE environment is a **free version** of the Nutanix software. It can be nested in an ESXi 6.0 U3 and up VMware environment or run as bare-metal.
To get access to the CE version 'click here <a href="https://www.nutanix.com/products/register/">'. This link also allows you to use the CE version. Yes we still need a license, but there are **no costs** for that use...

.. note:: As there is a lot of information in the internet how to install Nutanix CE we will not cover that. If you want to know how to install it in a nested environment, please search google on Nested Nutanix CE and you'll find multiple sites.
